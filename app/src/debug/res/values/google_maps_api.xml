    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=04:77:54:5D:B5:FE:D4:C3:85:CD:34:CC:A2:D9:87:04:6B:A2:17:43%3Bcom.gamedevelopment

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    04:77:54:5D:B5:FE:D4:C3:85:CD:34:CC:A2:D9:87:04:6B:A2:17:43;com.gamedevelopment

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
    -->
    <string name="google_maps_key" translatable="false" templateMergeStrategy="preserve">
        AIzaSyBZ6SLiP79aIiRO-0aAK3lFNnjyCS0M0UI
    </string>
